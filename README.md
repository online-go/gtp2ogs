# gtp2ogs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/online-go/gtp2ogs.svg?branch=devel)](https://travis-ci.org/online-go/gtp2ogs)

This javascript tool allows Go bots that support GTP 
[(Go Text Protocol)](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoTextProtocol) 
to communicate with OGS [(Online-Go.com Server)](https://online-go.com/)

No programming knowledge is needed to use it : just install it and it works.

Programming knowledge is needed only to add extra features such as displaying
and sending winrates and variations at every move, for example.

Note that some contributors already provide their custom gtp2ogs branches 
so you can download them directly or ask them if you want these features

When you have a bot on OGS, you have total control over it : 
you put it online when you want only, and there are many settings to choose 
game settings to accept (rank, boardisze, correspondence games, etc..), but 
also options to control your GPU/computing device power spent (max number of 
simultaneous games, corrqueue, etc..)

[for windows and linux, with screenshots, examples, and detailed explanations](https://github.com/wonderingabout/gtp2ogs-tutorial)

# Quick Guide

### 1. install node.js and npm

To install nodejs, you can :
- either use your system package manager (like apt-get for ubuntu)
- or download it from [nodejs website downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
for linux or windows

note : installing nodejs will also install npm = node package manager. Both 
will be needed later.

### 2. install gtp2ogs using npm

- For linux in terminal :

```
sudo npm install -g gtp2ogs
```

default path install is : 
> /usr/lib/node_modules/gtp2ogs/

- For windows, open a node.js command prompt as admin, then run this command :

```
npm install -g gtp2ogs
```

default path install is something like this :
> C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\gtp2ogs\


On all operating systems, gtp2ogs will be installed in 2 different directories, but 
**the one that needs to be run with node is gtp2ogs.js in node_modules directory**

### 3. Optional : install any missing node.js packages
 
**This step can be skipped unless you have issues or bugs**

you may need to install extra tools if the 
[Most common usage](https://github.com/wonderingabout/gtp2ogs/blob/clearer-devel/README.md#5-most-common-usage--start-gtp2ogsjs-using-nodejs) 
below fails, such as (run as `sudo` for linux, and as admin for windows)
 
```
npm install -g socket.io-client
npm install -g optimist
npm install -g tracer
  ```

### 4. Recommended : Upgrade to devel branch

This step is **is recommended**

By default, npm installs an old branch of gtp2ogs that does not include latest 
improvements, new features, and fixes

To upgrade to devel branch (newest), see :

- for linux : [3A3) Recommended : Upgrade gtp2ogs.js from old branch to “devel” branch (latest)](https://github.com/wonderingabout/gtp2ogs-tutorial/blob/master/docs/3A3-linux-optional-upgrade-to-devel.md)
- for windows : [3B3) Recommended : Upgrade gtp2ogs from old branch to devel (latest) branch](https://github.com/wonderingabout/gtp2ogs-tutorial/blob/master/docs/3B3-windows-optional-upgrade-to-devel.md)

When you upgrade you need to copy all the gtp2ogs files (bot.js, config.js, etc..) 
and overwrite the old files (you can backup your old files so that you can go back 
to the old version if you want later)

### 5. Most common usage : start gtp2ogs.js using nodejs

For linux (preferably as sudo) :

```
node /usr/lib/node_modules/gtp2ogs/gtp2ogs.js --username <yourbotusername> --apikey <apikey> <gtp2ogsargument1> <gtp2ogsargument2> -- /replace/with/full/path/to/your/ai/runfile.file <botargument1> <botargument2>
```

For windows (preferably as admin) : 

```
pushd C:\Program Files\nodejs && node.exe C:\Users\yourwindowsusername\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\gtp2ogs\gtp2ogs.js --username <yourbotusername> --apikey <apikey> <gtp2ogsargument1> <gtp2ogsargument2> -- C:\Users\path\to\your\ai\executable.exe <botargument1> <botargument2>
```

note : for all operating systems, in ` -- `, the spaces after `<gtp2ogsarguments>` 
and before `/path/to/your/bot.executable` are important : they separate gtp2ogs 
arguments from your bot arguments

note 2 : the number of <gtp2ogsarguments> and <botarguments> is not limited, 
here only 2 were shown but it possible to use for example 3,4,5 , or as many as 
you want
  
note 3 : to play on [beta OGS server](https://beta.online-go.com/) instead of the 
[OGS server](https://online-go.com/), add the `-- beta` argument

note 4 : it is possible to use ISSA (intuitive semi-syllabic aliases) to write 
your gtp2ogs arguments in a much smaller size, see [notes G-](/NOTES.md#g-) 
for details

### Extra : add features by editing gtp2ogs files

This step is totally not needed but can be much appreciated

To do that, programming knowledge is needed (or you can ask for help)

For example you can program gtp2ogs so that it sends winrate and 
playouts/visits information at every move, or even clickable variations, 
such as what [some bots](https://online-go.com/game/15926249) use for example.

# Options

Before putting `<gtp2ogsarguments>`, you have to put these options first :

  ```--username``` or `--u` Specify the username of the bot, for example `--username GnuGo`, 
currently there is no profile number log in support on ogs, see 
[notes A-](/NOTES.md#a-) for details

  ```--apikey``` or ```--a``` Specify the API key for the bot, for example `--apikey 5srvb5es4se7651741r61devr864re`

Then, the following options are placed in the above ```<gtp2ogsarguments>``` 
section. Put a space in between options when there are more than one.  
Also put a space in between the option and the parameter, for example :

  ```--startupbuffer 2 --boardsize 13,19 --noclock --unrankedonly --maxactivegames 1 --maxmaintime 1200 --ban UserX,playerY ---maxperiodsranked 5```
  
or with ISSA (intuitive semi-syllabic aliases) (see [notes G-](/NOTES.md#g-) for details), 
the same example becomes :
  
  ```--sb 2 --bb 13,19 --nc --uo --1ag 1 --1mt 1200 --b UserX,playerY --1pr 5```
  
note : some gtp2ogsarguments have default so they are enabled even if you don't 
specify them, such as `--komi` which default is automatic even if you dont specify it !
  
  below is a list of all possible to use gtp2ogs arguments, use the ones you want only, 
  no need to use them all !

  ```--host```  OGS Host to connect to (default online-go.com)

  ```--port``` OGS Port to connect to (default 443)

[OGS](https://online-go.com/) (sets ggs/rest hosts to the beta server)

  ```--debug``` or ```--d```  Output GTP command and responses from your Go engine

  ```--logfile``` or ```--l``` In addition to logging to the console, also log gtp2ogs 
output to a text file

is actually the maximum total number of connected games for your bot (correspondence 
games are currently included in the connected games count if you use `--persist` ) , 
which means the maximum number of games your bot can play at the same time (choose 
a low number to regulate your GPU use)

(for example to explain why, for how long, 
if your bot is busy playing a tournament, etc...)

  ```--rejectnewfile ~/rejectnew.status```  or ```--rf``` Reject new challenges if 
file exists (checked each time, can use for load-balancing)

# Discord chat : 

if you're read that far, maybe you'll be interested to share your bot experience with 
bot admins or see talked topic !

come on the leela zero discord in `#bots` channel and follow the talk with everyone !

https://discord.gg/HZ23Cp9

This discord can also be useful if you want to have fast and quick, interactive chat !

You can also use the discord to ask simple and quick questions

However, if you have a problem and it needs some explanations and time, it is common 
github practices to use the ["Issues"](https://github.com/online-go/gtp2ogs/issues) 
forum instead
